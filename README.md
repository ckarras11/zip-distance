Calculate distance between zip codes using the Haversine Formula

## Technical Challenge
For a coding challenge I was tasked with calculating the distance between two points given a zipcode without utilizing any external API's.  Using the zipcode and a database with the Lat and Long of each location, I was then able to calculate the distance in a straight line using the Haversine Formula.
